## üî¨ Research & Experience

**Research Associate @[The Micro-Flight Lab](https://www.beatus-lab.org/) - Hebrew University of Jerusalem** _(oct 2021 - present)_ <br>

Part of the "Robotic-fly" group, in which we, along-side [Rafael Ltd.](https://www.rafael.co.il/), develop
a biomimetic, flying, robotic insect. I was requested to join the group to
initiate the robot project, and my main responsibility is the integration of Reinforcement Learning tools with the robotic mechanism to 
optimize flight parameters such as lift and minimum work.
