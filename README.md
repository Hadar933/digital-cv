## üßë‚Äçüè´ Education

**M.Sc. Computer science - Hebrew University of Jerusalem**   _(oct 2021 - Present)_ <br>
  - One of the highest graded ML seminar presentations given (available [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oI3UvitekoTniCOtnQemC5ZpkfK15zMf/view))
  - Intro do Deep-Learning notes officially approved by course staff and shared with students (see [Git](https://github.com/Hadar933/Intro-to-Deep-Learning) or [Directly](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zVkw5lkE8bqBvSb5qZ4zdJX1pPC-F758/view))

**B.Sc. Computer science & Physics- Hebrew University of Jerusalem**   _(oct 2018 - oct 2021)_ <br>
  - Having completed physics related laboratory projects and various courses, gained introductory knowlege in data-based coding challenged such as data pre-processing, analyzing, regression and classification tasks, etc..


## üî¨ Research & Experience

**Research Associate @[The Micro-Flight Lab](https://www.beatus-lab.org/) - Hebrew University of Jerusalem** _(oct 2021 - present)_ <br>
Part of the "Robotic-fly" group, in which we, along-side [Rafael Ltd.](https://www.rafael.co.il/), develop
a biomimetic, flying, robotic insect. I was requested to join the group to
initiate the robot project, and my main responsibility is the integration of Reinforcement Learning tools with the robotic mechanism to 
optimize flight parameters such as lift and minimum work.

**Teaching Assistant - Hebrew University of Jerusalem** _(oct 2021 - present)_ <br>
Grading Computer Science BSc students in the courses Data structures
and Computational Models, Computability & Complexity

**Senior Sergeant - IDF School for Infantry Corps Professions and Squad Commanders** _(mar 2016- mar 2017)_ <br>
As per my military service, I was responsible for the qualification and training of 40 Infantry soldiers in
the process of becoming infantry commanders. Prior to that, I was a commander in the ‚ÄúGolani‚Äù infantry brigade

## üéØ Projects
- Worked on an Anomaly detection pipeline, based on deep networks' activations and committee k-nearest-neighbours (available [Here](https://github.com/Hadar933/Deep-Committee-kNN))
- Contributor and chapter author/editor in Machine & Deep learning In Hebrew Git repository
- (Scholarship) Accompanying first year students in their acclimatization to the university

## üíª Programming & Tools
**Python and ML**:

Four years of university experience including
- NumPy: image and signal processing, vectorization, and efficient implementations
- PyTorch: worked both with neural network implementations including MLPs, Recurrent NN, Conv NN, Generative models, Auto-Encoders and more. (either from scratch or with state-of-the-art modules) and with data processing pipelines and operations, such as working with dataloaders, transformations and more.
- Matplotlib: data plotting and visual representations
- Pandas: data analysis and pre-processing
- SciKit-Learn: working with known ML modules or implementing them
- Other APIs:  Integration with motors and controllers to drive robots (some of which include working with Arduino)
- 
**Other Tools**:
- C,C++: Both C,C++ and Operating systems university course knowledge such as threading, scheduling, working with memory, etc.. 
- JAVA: University Object Oriented course knowledge such as classes, inheritance, interfaces etc..
- MATLAB: Curve fitting with respect to physical theory and gathered data, as well as some basic coding.
